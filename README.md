Ride Hawaii
=====================

## Introduction

Ride Hawaii was originally created by four students as their final project for Cohort 9 of DevLeague in Honolulu, HI. The goal of this project is to create a geolocation app usable by bikers in the Honolulu area and to provide the following map information:
  Locations of future Bike Share sites, where bike rentals will be possible.
  History about nearby sites as a self-made tour.
  Locations of the bike racks that are available in Honolulu.
Other features of this app include user feedback and reporting, favoriting, and user location to point route information.
