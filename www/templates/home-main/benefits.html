          <h5>Community Resilience in Emergencies</h5>
          <p>Bikes are recognized as a viable form of transportation in emergency and disaster scenarios when other services such as roads and transit have not yet come back online. Having bikes in your community means that even in the most difficult situations, you can still function and access critical resources, and connect with loved ones. Bikeshare Hawaii is working with the Department of Emergency Management on incorporating itâ€™s program into disaster planning.</p>

          <h5>Historic and Cultural Identity</h5>
          <p>Bikeshare encourages people walk, bike, and explore new their neighborhoods at a pace that allows them to appreciate the unique character of each place. Through partnerships with historical researchers and our local cultural institutions, Bikeshare Hawaii will be featuring the context and heritage around our station locations using the station map panels to highlight what is special about each community.</p>

          <h5>Safer Pedestrians</h5>
          <p>The presence of bikes on roads generally slows auto traffic speeds and makes drivers more aware of non-automobile travelers. This provides a safety benefit to our most vulnerable travelers: Pedestrians!</p>
