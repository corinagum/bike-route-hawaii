The official presentation of the “Phoenix Fountain” was conducted by Consul General Moroi who announced the fountain was a “testimonial of friendship and equality of the Japanese residing in the Hawaiian Islands.”",
        "Unfortunately, such friendship and trust did not prevail over the years, the victim of racial turmoil generated by World War II.  Following the racial animosity generated by World War II, in 1943, the Phoenix Fountain was destroyed and turned to scrap.  A basic fountain was built.  Later, in the 1960s, the city constructed a fountain in honor of Louise Dillingham, who served many years as a member of the former City Parks Board (reportedly, the Walter and Louise Dillingham Foundation gave the fountain to the city in 1966.)

        "Kapi‘olani Park was dedicated on June 11, 1877 and named by King Kalākaua to honor his wife, Queen Kapi‘olani.  It was the first public park in the Hawaiian Islands.  The park was dedicated as \"a place of innocent refreshment for all who wish to leave the dust of the town street.\"  This area now includes Kapiʻolani Park, Waikīkī Zoo, Waikīkī Shell, Waikīkī War Memorial Natatorium and Waikīkī Aquarium.",
        "Characterized from the beginning as \"swamp land in a desert,\" Kapiʻolani Park became a park specifically because it wasn't considered suitable for anything else, and because of its peculiar climate - it's one of the few places on Oahu where rain almost never falls.  An important part of the initial park was its oval horse race track.  King Kalākaua reportedly liked gambling on horse racing and in 1872 he helped form The Hawaiian Jockey Club (this organized the sport according to the rules that governed races elsewhere.)

        "Although the park was initially touted to create \"a tract of land in the vicinity of Honolulu as a place of public resort,\" where \"agricultural and stock exhibitions, and healthful exercise, recreations and amusements\" could occur, its literal purpose was far from it.  On the dedication day in 1876, King Kalākaua and James Makee (Kapiʻolani Park Association’s first president) stressed the public space, which they said was needed for a modern city to be civilized, to allow \"families, children, and quiet people\" to find \"refreshment and recreation\" in the \"kindly influences of nature,\" and to be a \"place of innocent refreshment.\"",
        "However, when Kapiʻolani Park was first conceived, the motivation wasn’t about creating a public place.   Kapiʻolani Park began as a development project, run by the Kapiʻolani Park Association.  The association was founded with a two-fold purpose: (1) building residences for its stockholders along the ocean at Waikiki and on the slopes of Diamond Head and (2) laying out a first-class horse-racing track as a focal point of this new suburb.  200 shares were sold at $50 each. (King Kalākaua was a shareholder.)  Every owner received the right to lease a beachfront house lot in the park, and as a result a number of residences were built along the park's shores and around the race track during the 1880s.

Although the main issue was Cuban independence, the ten-week war was fought in both the Caribbean and the Pacific.",

On August 12, 1898, the United States ratified the Hawaiʻi treaty of annexation.  At the time, there was no assigned garrison here until August 15, 1898, when the 1st New York Volunteer Infantry regiment and the 3rd Battalion, 2nd US Volunteer Engineers landed in Honolulu for garrison duty at Camp McKinley.

Later, King Kamehameha V, held a celebration on his birthday, December 11, 1871, to honor Kamehameha I; “a public celebration was held with horse-riding and other sports.”  The date later moved to June 11, because of the better weather, and celebrated chiefly by horse races in Kapiʻolani Park, but the races eventually gave way to today’s parades of floats and pāʻū riders (that date became Kamehameha Day.)",

Simply look at the early history of trains and ships, the pattern is apparent.  Several in Hawai‘i followed this example in the planning of their transportation systems.",

        "William G Irwin was born in England in 1843; he was the son of James and Mary Irwin.  After the discovery of gold in 1849, the family then came to Hawaiʻi.  Irwin attended Punahou School and as a young man was employed at different times by Aldrich, Walker & Co.; Lewers & Dickson; and Walker, Allen & Co.",
        "In 1880, he and Claus Spreckels formed the firm WG Irwin & Co; for many years it was the leading sugar agency in the kingdom and the one originally used by the West Maui Sugar Association.  In 1885, Irwin and Spreckels opened the bank of Claus Spreckels & Co., later incorporated under the name of Bank of Honolulu, Ltd., that later merged with the Bank of Bishop & Co.  A close friend of King Kalākaua, Irwin was decorated by the King and was a member of the Privy Council of Hawaiʻi in 1887.  In 1896, the Legislature of the Republic of Hawaiʻi put Kapiʻolani Park and its management under the Honolulu Park Commission; William G Irwin was the first chair of the commission.  His Waikīkī home site was acquired for the Waikīkī Natatorium War Memorial.    Click Here for More Images and Information (http://wp.me/p5GnMi-fM)",

        "Intent on selling film, in 1937, Fritz Herman, then-vice president and manager of Kodak Hawaiʻi, founded the Kodak Hula Show. This allowed visitors to take pictures of hula shows outdoors in the daylight (rather than at the too-dark venues of the nighttime lūʻau.)  In addition, Herman wanted dancers to wear ti-leaf skirts and pose in natural settings, rather than the typical nighttime indoor wardrobe of cellophane skirts and paper lei. ",
        "The first show, on the lawn behind the beach at San Souci, featured five dancers, four musicians and an audience of 100. The popular shows later expanded to 20 female and six male performers, 15 musicians, two chanters and audiences of 3,000 each week.  For many tourists, their only exposure to Hawaiian dance was the Kodak Hula Show.  And, it was free.  After months of looking for a suitable sponsor to assume the operation of the Hula Show, the show was officially closed on September 26, 2002.  An estimated 20-million people had seen the show from 1937-2002.     Click Here for More Images and Information (http://wp.me/p5GnMi-8B)",

        "Images of Old Hawai'i",
        "Starting in 1888, Robert Lewis Stevenson (born in Edinburgh Scotland on November 13th 1850,) the famous author of popular works such as 'Treasure Island' and 'Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde,' began a tour of the South Pacific, visiting Tahiti and the Marquesas.  For nearly ten years his health had been declining; he was told by his doctor to travel there because the climate was good for his bad health.",
        "In 1889, he arrived in Honolulu and spent the first six months of that year in the Hawaiian Islands (he later settled and lived in Samoa.)  Stevenson visited Kalaupapa (shortly after Damien’s death) and later wrote of the good work of Father Damien (now Saint Damien.)  He also travelled to Kona on the Big Island (the setting for most of his short story “The Bottle Imp.”)  On Oʻahu, Stevenson was introduced to the King Kalākaua and others in the royal family by fellow Scotsman, Archibald Cleghorn.  Stevenson established a fast friendship with the royal family and spent a lot of time with his good friend King Kalākaua.    Click Here for More Images and Information (http://wp.me/p5GnMi-ip)",
